The charged disk folder contains a library of function for running the simulations

Basefuncs deals with the simulated annealing algorithm steps and energy calculation and so on and so forth 
Simulation deals with running a simulation and terminating the program when a degree of accuracy is met
Timing was just for timeing funcitons and test was for testing bits of code

Run_model_v2 runs the simulation in totailty and deals with saving the data and running for different charges etc. calculating the initial parameters and the temperature reduction and such

Sigma testing was to try and calculate the errors on the energy standard deviations and the random walk simulation used to calculate the steps needed
Stability testing was all to do with testing final configurations for stability and to see if they were a local minima, similar code to original simulation.

Best of luck looking through it all!
